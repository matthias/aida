Aida - Where Helma Goes to Work
===============================

Aida should become a RubyOnRais style MVC framework, based on helma-ng.
As of today (June 3rd, 2008) it supports routing, controllers, helpers, views (skins, EcmaScript templates, JavaScript Templates) 
and it includes the Hibernate ORM/persistence layer from robi.

You will find some basic documentation at /aida/doc/modules/aida

How to Run "demo-app"
=====================

demo-app contains all you need to run the examples. As it also includes robi's orm mapper
you need to run mysql and create a database.

1. Start your MySQL server and create the DB & user with:
   demo-app/app/orm/db.sql

2. Issue, e.g., the following command from the aida directory:

   aida> java -jar ~/helma/helma-ng/run.jar demo-app/ modules/
   # modify the pathes according to your needs

3. Then point your browser to:

   http://localhost:8080/


Description
===========

The demo-app also includes a library for generating xml (and html) and a library
that wraps the twitter api.

 * /blog ... A simple blog app, including robi's hibernate module.
 * /twitter ... Using the twitter API and skins.
 * /say ... Just a place where i test routes, and controllers (broken).

Watch the URLs as you browse the demo apps. You will find the routes in _/app/routes_

All modules are located at _/modules/adia_. You don't have to copy them into your helma installation, they are loaded in _main.js_ by calling _importModule("aida.appLoader");_
