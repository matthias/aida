/**
 * The Load Path 
 * The standard environment automatically includes the following directories 
 * (relative to your application’s base directory) into your application’s load path. 
 * <li>test/mocks/environment. Because these are ﬁrst in the load path, classes 
 * deﬁned here override the real versions, enabling you to replace live func- 
 * tionality with stub code during testing.
 * <li>The app/controllers directory and its subdirectories. 
 * <li>All directories whose names start with an underscore or a lowercase letter 
 * under app/models and components. 
 * <li>The directories app, app/models, app/controllers, app/helpers, app/ser vices, 
 * app/apis, components, conﬁg, lib, and vendor.
